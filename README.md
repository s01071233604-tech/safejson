# SafeJSON — The JSON tool that never sees your data

A privacy-first JSON formatter. Format, validate, and debug JSON entirely in your browser. No server. No ads. No tracking.

## Why SafeJSON?

In November 2025, popular online JSON tools were caught leaking over 80,000 credentials — AWS keys, GitHub tokens, and banking details. Around the same time, the most popular JSON Formatter browser extension (2M+ users) was sold, closed-sourced, and injected with adware.

SafeJSON is different: **all processing happens in your browser. Zero network requests.**

## Features

### Web Tool ([safejson.dev](https://safejson.dev))
- Instant JSON formatting with syntax highlighting
- Collapsible tree view for exploring nested structures
- Error detection with line and column numbers
- Copy / Download formatted JSON
- Dark theme by default
- Cmd+Enter to format

### Browser Extension
- Auto-detects JSON responses on any URL
- Syntax highlighting: strings (green), numbers (gold), booleans (cyan), null (gray)
- One-click Copy / Raw toggle
- "Open in SafeJSON" button for full tree view inspection
- Available on Edge Add-ons

## How to verify the privacy claim

1. Open [safejson.dev](https://safejson.dev)
2. Open DevTools → Network tab
3. Paste any JSON
4. Observe: **zero network requests**

All formatting runs client-side. Your data never leaves your browser.

## Competitive context

jsonformatter.org and codebeautify.org were found by security researchers at watchTowr (November 2025) to have leaked over 80,000 user credentials — including AWS keys, GitHub tokens, and banking details — through an unprotected "Recent Links" feature. The data was accessible without authentication, and attackers were confirmed to be actively scraping the data within 48 hours.

SafeJSON was built in response: if all processing happens in the browser, there is nothing to leak.
