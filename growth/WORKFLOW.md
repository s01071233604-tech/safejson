# SafeJSON Growth Workflow

Goal: turn SafeJSON from "working product" into repeatable discovery, trial, and paid Pro activation.

## Operating Principle

Every growth action should strengthen one of four loops:

1. Search discovery: more indexable, useful pages for developer queries.
2. AI discovery: direct facts that AI search engines can cite.
3. Developer trust: verifiable privacy, open source, clear evidence.
4. Revenue: visitors try Pro tools, hit the free limit, buy, and activate a license key.

## Weekly Loop

### 1. Monday - Health Check

Codex can run:

```bash
npm run growth:check
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Check:

- `https://www.safejson.dev/llms.txt` is live and current.
- `/pricing` explains checkout, license keys, and 2-device activation.
- `/answers` contains direct Pro and privacy facts for AI search.
- Core pages return 200.
- Lemon Squeezy license endpoints reject invalid input correctly.
- Sitemap and robots are reachable.

User only needs to step in if Google Search Console, Lemon Squeezy, or external platform dashboards require manual login.

### 2. Tuesday - SEO/GEO Content

Codex can do:

- Refresh one existing page with a clearer answer, FAQ, or comparison table.
- Add one buyer-intent page when a keyword gap is clear.
- Update `public/llms.txt` when pricing, licensing, or positioning changes.
- Add structured data when the page has clear FAQ, Product, SoftwareApplication, HowTo, or Breadcrumb intent.

User should provide:

- Semrush/GSC screenshots when available.
- Any real customer question or complaint.
- Any claim that needs first-hand founder voice.

### 3. Wednesday - Distribution

Codex can do:

- Prepare final copy for directories, GitHub, DEV.to, Indie Hackers, Hacker News, and Product Hunt.
- Update GitHub README and repo metadata.
- Submit low-risk forms only when the platform is open, logged in, and does not require human community judgment.

User should do:

- Reddit posts/comments.
- Product Hunt launch account actions.
- Any platform with high anti-spam sensitivity.
- Any comment thread that needs a real founder voice.

### 4. Thursday - Conversion

Codex can do:

- Audit pricing and unlock flow.
- Verify Lemon Squeezy license activation.
- Improve "what happens after checkout" copy.
- Add support answers for failed activation, refund, and device-limit questions.

User should do:

- Refund/customer support decisions.
- Lemon Squeezy dashboard changes that expose private account controls.
- Payment-provider identity or tax settings.

### 5. Friday - Measurement

Codex can compile:

- Indexed pages from GSC screenshots.
- Bing/IndexNow submission status.
- GitHub stars/referrers if available.
- Pro checkout clicks and completed purchases if the dashboard is available.
- Top pages and queries from GA/GSC screenshots.

Decision rule:

- If pages are not indexed: prioritize crawl/index fixes.
- If indexed but no clicks: improve titles, snippets, and external links.
- If traffic but no Pro trials: improve tool-page CTAs.
- If Pro trials but no purchases: improve pricing, limit timing, or checkout clarity.
- If purchases but activation problems: improve license flow and support copy.

## Current SafeJSON Positioning

Primary message:

> The JSON tool that never sees your data. Prove it yourself.

Verification:

> Open DevTools -> Network, paste JSON, use the tool, and confirm there are no data-upload requests for pasted content.

Revenue offer:

> Free core JSON formatter. Pro tools for JSON Diff, JWT Decoder, JSONPath, and JSON Schema Validator at $5/month or $39/year. One license activates up to 2 devices.

## Codex Runbook

For each growth iteration:

1. Inspect git state and do not touch unrelated untracked files.
2. Review production pages before changing content.
3. Make the smallest useful change to one loop.
4. Run `npm run growth:check`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`.
5. Commit with a clear message.
6. Push to GitHub and verify Vercel production.
7. Submit IndexNow after deploy when indexable pages changed.
8. Report what changed, what was verified, and what needs user action.

## User Escalation Triggers

Ask the user only when:

- A platform requires identity, billing, tax, or account-risk action.
- A community post could look spammy without founder context.
- A claim needs legal, security, or first-hand confirmation.
- A dashboard has private customer/payment data that should not be exposed in chat.
