## DEV.to Article Draft

Title:

I built a JSON formatter you can verify with DevTools

Tags:

`webdev`, `javascript`, `security`, `opensource`

Body:

```markdown
I kept seeing the same developer habit: copy a production API response, paste it into a random JSON formatter, fix the bug, move on.

That is convenient, but it is also a weird amount of trust.

In November 2025, security researchers reported that JSONFormatter and CodeBeautify exposed 80,000+ saved snippets with credentials and sensitive data. The lesson is not "never format JSON online." The lesson is: a JSON tool should not need your data to leave your browser.

So I built SafeJSON:

https://www.safejson.dev

The core idea is verifiable privacy.

You do not have to trust the homepage copy. You can check it:

1. Open SafeJSON
2. Open DevTools
3. Open the Network tab
4. Paste JSON
5. Format, validate, diff, or inspect it
6. Confirm that pasted content is not uploaded

The free tools include:

- JSON formatter
- JSON validator
- JSON beautifier
- JSON viewer
- JSON parser
- CSV to JSON
- JSON to CSV

Pro tools are:

- JSON Diff
- JWT Decoder
- JSONPath Query
- JSON Schema Validator

The project is open source:

https://github.com/s01071233604-tech/safejson

I am trying to keep the product simple: free core formatter, paid advanced tools, no ads, no tracking, and no server-side JSON processing.

Feedback I am especially looking for:

- Does the DevTools verification feel clear?
- Which JSON workflow is still annoying in your day-to-day work?
- Would you trust a browser-only JSON tool more than a server-side formatter?
```

## Indie Hackers Post

Title:

I launched a privacy-first JSON formatter with a simple paid Pro tier

Body:

```text
I launched SafeJSON: https://www.safejson.dev

It is a JSON formatter and developer toolkit built around one idea: users should be able to verify that their JSON never leaves the browser.

The test is simple:

Open DevTools -> Network -> paste JSON -> use the tool -> confirm there are no data-upload requests for pasted content.

Free:
- formatter
- validator
- beautifier
- viewer
- parser
- CSV conversion

Pro ($5/month or $39/year):
- JSON Diff
- JWT Decoder
- JSONPath
- JSON Schema Validator

The payment and license flow is now live through Lemon Squeezy. Each license activates up to 2 devices.

I am using this as a small, focused experiment in developer-tool monetization: no ads, no tracking, no uploading user JSON.

Would love feedback on the positioning and pricing.

## Hacker News / Show HN Draft

Title:

Show HN: SafeJSON - a JSON formatter you can verify with DevTools

Body:

```text
Hi HN, I built SafeJSON, a browser-based JSON formatter and developer toolkit:

https://www.safejson.dev

The main idea is verifiable privacy. Open DevTools -> Network, paste JSON, use the formatter, and confirm that the pasted data is not uploaded.

It includes free formatter/validator/viewer/parser tools, plus paid Pro tools for JSON Diff, JWT decoding, JSONPath, and JSON Schema validation.

The project is open source:
https://github.com/s01071233604-tech/safejson

I built it after seeing how often developers paste production API responses, JWTs, and config blobs into random online tools. Feedback welcome, especially on the privacy verification flow.
```

User should post this one manually. HN is sensitive to tone and history.

## GitHub Discussion / Issue Draft

Title:

Feedback wanted: is the DevTools privacy verification clear?

Body:

```markdown
SafeJSON's core positioning is "verify, don't trust."

The intended user flow:

1. Open SafeJSON
2. Open DevTools -> Network
3. Paste JSON
4. Use formatter, diff, JWT decoder, JSONPath, or schema validator
5. Confirm that pasted content is not uploaded

Question: is this verification flow obvious enough from the homepage and tool UI?

Feedback welcome on:

- wording
- trust signals
- confusing parts of the Pro license flow
- missing JSON workflows
```
