# SafeJSON Submission Tracker

This tracker turns SEO/GEO distribution into an execution loop. Update it after every external submission, community post, directory listing, or citation-worthy mention.

## Current Readiness

| Area | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production site | Ready | https://www.safejson.dev |
| SEO/GEO health check | Ready | `npm run growth:check` should pass before each distribution wave |
| Posting copy | Ready | `growth/POSTING-PACK-001.md` |
| Pricing and license flow | Ready | `/pricing`, `/unlock`, Lemon Squeezy license activation |
| AI crawler files | Ready | `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, `/robots.txt` |
| Trust signals | Ready | Open source repo, security headers, `/.well-known/security.txt` |

## Ownership Rules

Codex can complete tasks when they are low-risk, technical, and do not require a personal account, captcha, payment account, or community judgment.

The user should complete tasks when the platform depends on founder identity, account reputation, anti-spam judgment, or private dashboard access.

## Weekly Execution Checklist

2. Check Google Search Console indexing screenshots and Bing Webmaster status if available.
3. Pick one SEO/GEO content improvement and one distribution action.
4. Update `public/llms.txt` and `public/llms-full.txt` if product facts changed.
5. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before code/content deploys.
6. Commit, push, and verify Vercel production.
7. Submit IndexNow when indexable pages changed.
8. Add external submission proof links to this tracker.

## This Week's Priority Order

1. Verify SaaSHub and Indie Hackers claimed submissions — add proof URLs to tracker.
2. Publish DEV.to article (draft ready in `OUTREACH-WAVE-001.md`).
3. Create GitHub Discussion feedback thread.
4. Complete LinkedIn company page registration; add to schema sameAs.
5. Publish LinkedIn founder post (draft in `OUTREACH-WAVE-001.md`).
6. Prepare Product Hunt full launch draft (do not launch until profile and visuals are ready).
7. Submit AlternativeTo on/after June 18 (account age requirement).
8. Prepare Reddit recovery post for June 25 (draft in `OUTREACH-WAVE-001.md`).

## Decision Rules

- If the site is still not indexed, prioritize crawl/index proof over more copywriting.
- If pages are indexed but impressions are low, add external mentions and target narrower long-tail pages.
- If impressions exist but clicks are low, rewrite titles and meta descriptions.
- If clicks exist but Pro trials are low, strengthen tool-page CTAs and Pro gating copy.
- If Pro trials exist but purchases are low, improve pricing proof, checkout clarity, and license activation support.
