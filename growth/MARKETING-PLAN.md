# SafeJSON Marketing Plan — 90-Day + 12-Month

**Date:** 2026-06-12
**Stage:** Bootstrapped, pre-revenue, 6 weeks old
**Current ARR:** $0 (no paying Pro users yet)
**Team:** Solo founder + Claude/Codex
**Budget:** ~$0/mo (free tools + time)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

SafeJSON is a privacy-first JSON developer toolkit with a unique and verifiable differentiator: pasted JSON is never uploaded. Every tool runs in the browser. This is verifiable via DevTools Network tab.

**3 Big Bets (12 months):**
1. **Own "safe JSON formatter" as a category** — no competitor claims verifiable client-side processing. Win the long-tail SEO queries around JSON tool safety before the category forms.
2. **Turn the 80K credential leak into sustained distribution** — every developer who learns about the jsonformatter.org breach is a potential SafeJSON user. Systematize this via comparison pages, blog content, and community presence.
3. **Pro as revenue engine** — $5/mo × 200 users = $1K MRR. Achievable with 3.2M monthly searches for "JSON formatter" and a 0.006% conversion rate.

**90-Day Priority:**
- Weeks 1-2: Complete external presence (LinkedIn, GitHub discoverability, AlternativeTo)
- Weeks 3-4: Content velocity (2 blog posts, Pro tool page FAQs, "I Audited 10 Tools" post)
- Weeks 5-8: Community building (Reddit recovery, DEV.to weekly, Indie Hackers updates)
- Weeks 9-12: Conversion optimization (Pro gating A/B test, checkout analytics, license flow)

---

## 2. Strategic Frame

**Category claim:** The JSON tool that never sees your data. Prove it yourself.

**ICP distilled:** Developers who paste API responses, JWTs, config files, logs, and production JSON into online tools. They value privacy but don't think about it until they've already pasted something sensitive.

**Business model logic:** Freemium — free core tools capture search traffic; Pro tools ($5/mo) convert power users. One license = 2 devices. Lemon Squeezy handles payments.

**Brand voice non-negotiables:**
- Developer-first, not marketing-speak
- Dark, minimal, utilitarian (no UI redesigns)
- Claims are verifiable (always point to DevTools Network tab)
- NEVER say "zero network requests" (GA is installed)
- NEVER say "no tracking" (GA is installed)
- CORRECT: "no pasted-content upload," "no pasted-content analytics," "verify in DevTools"

**Phase of SaaS growth:** $0-10K ARR (Product phase). Binding constraint: discoverability.

| Area | Score | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Product | 5/5 | Live, working, statically prerendered |
| GEO/SEO foundation | 4/5 | 66/100 composite, llms.txt, CSP, security.txt, sitemap |
| Content | 2/5 | 2 blog posts, 3 DEV.to posts, /answers, 6 VS pages. Thin on Pro tool pages |
| Distribution | 2/5 | 4 directories submitted, DEV.to active, GitHub Discussion #1 |
| Brand authority | 1/5 | 24/100 — minimal platform presence |
| Conversion | 1/5 | Pro gating works, no paying users yet, no conversion analytics |
| Community | 1/5 | No Reddit, no Discord, no mailing list |
| Analytics | 2/5 | GA installed, privacy-respecting events configured, no funnels |
| Team | 1/5 | Solo founder + AI agents |

## 4. Acquisition

### Channels: Current + Planned

| Channel | Status | 90-Day Move | 12-Month Move |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Organic search (SEO) | Active | Target 4 zero-competition keywords | Rank top 3 for "safe JSON formatter" |
| GEO (AI citation) | Active | llms.txt updates monthly | Wikidata entry when notability met |
| DEV.to | Active | Weekly posts, cross-post from blog | Build 1K followers |
| Indie Hackers | Submitted | Weekly build-in-public updates | Build 500 followers |
| GitHub | Active | Discussions engagement, stars | 100+ stars |
| Hacker News | Draft ready | Show HN when 3+ directories confirmed | — |
| Reddit | Blocked until June 25 | r/SideProject recovery post | Organic presence in r/webdev |
| Directories | 4 submitted | AlternativeTo (June 18), 5 more | 15+ total listings |
| Product Hunt | Live | Listing cleanup (wording, URL, screenshots) | "Users Love Us" badge when 20+ reviews |
| LinkedIn | Pending | Founder post + company page | Weekly content |

### Skipped (with rationale)
- **Paid ads:** No budget, no proven CAC. Revisit at $1K MRR.
- **YouTube:** Requires video production capacity. Revisit when 2+ tutorial scripts are ready.
- **Wikipedia:** No independent coverage yet. Revisit when TechCrunch/Verge/developer press covers SafeJSON.
- **Cold email:** No ICP list built. Low priority for developer tool.

---

## 5. Activation

**Current flow:** Land on homepage → auto-filled sample JSON → use free tools → hit Pro limit → pricing page → Lemon Squeezy checkout → unlock page → license activation.

**90-Day improvements:**
- Add "first format" success micro-interaction (subtle, developer-appropriate)
- Pro limit reached → add "You've used 5/5 free runs. Unlock $5/mo." with direct link
- Unlock page: show license key format hint before paste

**12-Month:** A/B test Pro gating (3 free runs vs 5 vs 7). Add "team" license tier if demand exists.

---

## 6. Retention

Not applicable at current stage (no users to retain). Foundation work:
- Privacy policy already transparent about GA
- License activation flow works (validated by growth:check)
- Support page has verification tutorial

---

## 7. Referral

Not applicable at current stage. Foundation:
- Open source (MIT) = natural developer sharing
- "Verify in DevTools" = viral-ready mechanic (teach others to check)
- GitHub stars as social proof

---

## 8. Revenue

**Current pricing:** Free core / $5/mo Pro / $39/year Pro. 2 devices per license. Lemon Squeezy.

**Target:** 200 Pro users = $1K MRR. At jsonformatter.org's 3.2M monthly visits, this requires 0.006% conversion.

**12-Month path:** $5/mo → add team tier ($15/mo for 5 seats) → add enterprise (custom). Do not change current pricing until data exists.

## 12. Open Decisions

1. **CAC unknown** — no conversion data yet. Every projection is estimated. Solve by week 12 with GA funnel data.
2. **Wikidata timing** — notability risk. Reassess after 3+ independent press mentions.
3. **Show HN timing** — Product Hunt is live. Defer until PH listing is cleaned up and 5+ directory listings are confirmed.
4. **Real name vs pseudonym** — "Lizzy_Megamind" flagged as CRITICAL EEAT risk. Founder decision required.
5. **Cookie consent** — GDPR gap. GA loads unconditionally. Add consent banner or switch to cookieless analytics.
6. **YouTube channel** — high AI citation correlation (0.737) but requires video production. Cost/benefit TBD.
